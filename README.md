# KoReader-Hide-Title-Bar-Icons-Patch
A patch to hide the title bar icons in library view (file browser) for maximum cleanliness.
Includes a toggle in the menu so you can enable and deisable.
WARNING: When enabled, multi book selection breaks as the "check" icon in the titlebar will be hidden as well, so you'll have to disable this patch first in the menu before trying to do any multi-selection operations.
